## 1) Competitor Snapshot (fictional data)
| Competitor | Distance | Google Rating | Review Count | Notable Offer/Focus |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Zahnstudio Aurora Mitte | 0.7 km | 4.9 | 312 | "Same-day" veneers program + extended Saturday hours |
| SmileQuarter Friedrichstraße | 1.2 km | 4.6 | 487 | Subscription whitening (€29/mo) + in-app reminders |
| UrbanAlign Berlin Central | 1.8 km | 4.4 | 205 | Hybrid aligner + general dentistry packages |

## 2) Review Themes (fictional)
**Top praise** — friendly concierge-style reception, 10-minute average wait time, ambient “spa” rooms, clear cost estimate PDFs.  
**Top complaints** — hard-to-reach phone line, confusing Aligner aftercare instructions, parking tips missing on websites.

## 3) Pricing / Service Signals (fictional)
- Competitor landing pages highlight bundled plans (e.g., "Aligner + hygiene" for €149/mo) and real-time financing calculators.
- Two clinics advertise 36h turnaround for crowns with on-site labs; one markets a “Nightline” WhatsApp triage for urgent pain cases.

## 4) SEO Gaps (fictional)
**Keywords rivals rank for:** "Zahnarzt Berlin Mitte Ratenzahlung", "Aligner Notdienst Mitte", "Bleaching innerhalb 24 Stunden".  
**Missing on your site:** dedicated copy for rapid crowns, financing FAQ, WhatsApp availability badges, fresh patient stories (last blog update mid-2023).

## 5) 5-Point Action List (fictional)
1. Launch a micro-landing page for “Aligner Berlin Mitte” with before/after gallery and a 3-step financing widget.
2. Add clear “call / WhatsApp” hours inside Google Business + hero banner to signal short response times.
3. Automate review requests via SMS + QR code at checkout; target +25 new Google reviews within 30 days.
4. Refresh your dental spa positioning: highlight lounge photos, aromatherapy, noise-canceling headphones.
5. Publish three short blog posts (“Last-minute crowns”, “Transparent pricing”, “Aligner aftercare checklist”) to re-activate SEO.
